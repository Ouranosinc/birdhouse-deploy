# Ensure this combinabion of "hostname.domain" name really exist on the DNS of
# the network you are bridging onto.
#
# "hostname.domain" will be used as PAVICS_FQDN in env.local file.
#
# If this combinabion of "hostname.domain" name do not exist on the DNS, use
# the override mechanism https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/ to add the
# extra DNS entry and also set it manually in your
# /etc/hosts file.
hostname: mypavics
domain: ouranos.ca

# Set network bridge, else you'll simply be prompted on vagrant up.
# network_bridge: enp0s25

# Set hostip if you want to force an IP, useful to keep the same IP after each
# VM destroy and recreate.
# hostip: 1.2.3.4

# Force a default gateway if networking issue (ex: VM in a different DMZ VLan).
# default_gateway: 1.2.3.4

# Datasets dirs on the host to be mounted read-only into the VM at the same
# location, useful to avoid having to copy those gigantic netCDF files to the
# VM disk.
# Can use sshfs if the datasets are really large to avoid having to copy it
# locally.  Ex:
#   sshfs -o ro -o allow_other datahost:/mount/DATA /data/datasets
#datasets_dirs:
# - { srcdir: "/data/datasets", destdir: "/data/datasets" }
# - { srcdir: "/data/datasets-priv", destdir: "/data/datasetsPrivate" }
# - { srcdir: "C:/data/datasets", destdir: "/data/datasets" }

# If you want to provide a SSL certificate yourself, name it 'certkey.pem' and
# it won't be overriden, see vagrant-utils/configure-pavics.sh.  Otherwise one
# will be generated automatically for you.

# If you want to provide an env.local yourself, just create it and it won't be
# overriden, see vagrant-utils/configure-pavics.sh for what values vagrant
# expects and try to match it.  Otherwise one will be generated automatically
# for you from the default values in env.local.example.

# SSH deploy key to be used with the automated unattended deploy script.
